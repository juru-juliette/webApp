Regular Expressions are search strings used to locate and manipulate content that matches a particular pattern. 
Here is an example of a variable set to a regular expression:
var sample_regex = /moringaschool/gi
The characters between the / slashes represent the regular expression. The characters following the regular expression, gi, are modifiers. The g stands for "global" and the "i" stands for case-insensitive.
